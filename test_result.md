# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Tested complete navigation flow: 1) Initialization returns plant suggestions including 'AMMUNITION FACTORY KHADKI' with human-friendly language (no DB terms). 2) Plant level navigation works with conversational responses mentioning sections like 'CASE 4'. 3) Section level navigation describes sections naturally with item suggestions. 4) Item level navigation provides detailed quality/inspection information with visualization suggestions. 5) Chart generation works at item level creating line charts with proper structure. 6) Table generation returns structured data with columns and rows. 7) Session persistence maintains context across messages with proper tree_path tracking. All responses are conversational without database terminology."

Chart data structure includes proper type, title, data with labels/datasets, responsive options, and styling. API correctly returns chart_data for chart requests and null for non-chart requests. All 11 backend API tests passed (100% success rate). Chart data validation shows proper structure with realistic sample data, proper color schemes, and complete configuration for frontend rendering."

        comment: "✅ HIERARCHICAL CHATBOT TESTING COMPLETE: Tested new hierarchical data structure with conversational navigation. Chart generation works correctly at ITEM level with contextual data. Successfully generated line charts for quality trends using inspection readings. Chart requests like 'Create a chart' work perfectly, returning proper chart_data with type, title, labels, and datasets. Minor issue: Some specific phrases like 'Show me quality trends' may trigger navigation instead of chart generation due to embedding-based intent parsing, but core chart functionality is solid."

The API provides human-friendly responses without database terminology, maintains proper context across navigation levels, and generates contextual charts/tables based on current location in the hierarchy. Redis integration working properly for session management."
